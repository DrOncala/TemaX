    <h3>2010–2014 — Degree in Physics, University of Barcelona</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was living in Sant Boi de Llobregat, my hometown, when I started my studies in Physics at the University of Barcelona. 
        I graduated with a specialization in High Energy Physics and began exploring the world of quarks, governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). 
        My final degree thesis on tetraquarks is still available online.

  <h3>2014–2016 — Master's in Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics, University of Barcelona</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      While studying these two master's degrees, one after the other, I began working on quarkonia — bound states made of two heavy quarks. 
      They can be studied within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework. 
      One possible configuration of these bound states is hybrid quarkonia, exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom. 
      As the final project for my master's thesis, I published a paper showing how quarkonia and hybrid quarkonia are strong candidates for the XYZ mesons — 
      a family of recently discovered particles that are still not well understood.
