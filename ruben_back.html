    <h3>2010–2014 — Degree in Physics, University of Barcelona</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I was living in Sant Boi de Llobregat, my hometown, when I started my studies in Physics at the University of Barcelona. 
        I graduated with a specialization in High Energy Physics and began exploring the world of quarks, governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). 
        My <a href="https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/67340">final degree thesis</a> on tetraquarks is still available online.

  <h3>2014–2016 — Master's in Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics, University of Barcelona</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      While studying these two master's degrees, one after the other, I began working on quarkonia — bound states made of two heavy quarks. 
      They can be studied within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework. 
      One possible configuration of these bound states is hybrid quarkonia, exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom. 
      As the final project for my master's thesis I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.014004"> my first paper</a>, showing how quarkonia and hybrid quarkonia are strong candidates for the XYZ mesons — 
      a family of recently discovered particles that are still not well understood.

  <h3>2016–2021 — Ph.D. in High Energy Physics, University of Amsterdam</h3>
  <div>
    <h4>Amsterdam period</h4>
    <p>
      At that time, I was excited to move to Amsterdam to begin my doctoral studies at the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics (<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/en/events/phd-defense-ruben-oncala-mesa-uva/">Nikhef</a>), where I pursued my Ph.D. in High Energy Physics. 
      There, I studied Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Effective Field Theories (EFTs) to better understand the formation of dark-matter bound states in the early universe. 
      During my time in Amsterdam, I also began my teaching career as an assistant lecturer for two consecutive years in the course 
      Statistical Physics — part of the second-year Physics degree program at the University of Amsterdam, where I eventually defended <a href="
    https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/7a6b95c4-2324-4d1c-a7cb-b11fa9efe0aa">my Ph.D. thesis</a> and earned my doctoral degree.
    </p>

    <h4>Paris period</h4>
    <p>
      During my contract at Nikhef, I was sent on a research mission to the <em>Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Hautes Énergies</em> (<a href="https://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/static/en/index.html">LPTHE</a>) at Sorbonne University in Paris. 
      There, I continued exploring long-range interactions in non-relativistic systems, focusing on how such forces can lead to the formation of bound states. 
      Working closely with researchers from both institutes gave me a broader and more unified perspective on the mechanisms that govern these systems. 
      This collaboration also opened the door to a new line of research, where I investigated the possible connection between dark matter and ordinary matter through the Higgs portal — 
      work that ultimately led to <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/2897348?ui-citation-summary=true">several publications</a>.

  <h3>2021–2023 — Break</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      After a few years of study and a pandemic that was about to end, I decided to take a break and move to the Canary Islands.
      There, I enjoyed the two best years of my life to the date: spending time with my cousins, going to the beach, soaking up the sun, training, 
      and kayaking around the islands in an endless summer while taking time for myself.
      During this period, I learned that you don't have to go anywhere, that life is truly worth living when you enjoy the journey, 
      and that goals are sometimes just unconscious beliefs that can hold you back.

  <h3>2023–Present — Lecturer and Researcher at Universidad San Pablo CEU</h3>
  <div>
  <p>
  After a period of rest, I began my current position as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Universidad San Pablo CEU. 
  I truly enjoy teaching because it is, in essence, another way of learning. 
  I value the time I spend with my students — not only for the human interaction but also because I learn from them. 
  Teaching challenges me to improve continuously: to express ideas more clearly, to revisit earlier concepts I may have forgotten, 
  and to strengthen my own understanding. 
  I also find deep satisfaction in sharing knowledge. I believe that what we know belongs to each of us individually, 
  but knowledge itself belongs to everyone. 
  With this conviction, I created <em>Tema X</em> — a project to share my perspective on mathematics and to reveal the hidden beauty that lies behind its equations.
</p>
<p>
  Teaching has proven even more powerful than I had imagined. 
  It is the tool that gives me freedom and allows me to explore what fascinates me most: 
  the fundamental constituents of our universe — quarks and their interactions.
