  <h3>Research Interests</h3>

  <p>Quarks are the elementary constituents of matter, and their interactions via gluons—the carriers of the strong force—are central to understanding the behavior of matter at the most fundamental level. The strong force is unique among the four fundamental forces for exhibiting confinement at low energies, making its study particularly challenging. Traditionally, quarks were observed only in hadrons as quark-antiquark pairs (mesons, such as the pion) or in groups of three (baryons, such as protons and neutrons).<p> 
  <p>However, in the past two decades, new exotic hadrons, called <strong>XYZ states</strong>, have been discovered at particle accelerator experiments worldwide, observed in —the <strong>quark-gluon plasma</strong>—, produced briefly in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at facilities such as the <strong>LHC (CERN, Switzerland)</strong> and <strong>RHIC (USA)</strong>.
 These states display striking and unexpected properties, and their internal structure in terms of quarks and gluons remains unclear.</p>

  <p>My research focuses on investigating these new forms of matter. By combining <strong>quantum effective field theories</strong> with advanced <strong>computer simulations</strong>, I aim to calculate the properties of XYZ states, providing new insights into the fundamental nature of the strong force.</p>

  <p>To understand the nature of XYZ mesons, I study both <strong>theoretical particle physics</strong> and <strong>nuclear physics</strong>, focusing on the dynamics of the strong interaction. Strongly coupled gauge theories play a central role in explaining quark and gluon confinement. My work centers on <strong>Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)</strong> and related <strong>Effective Field Theories</strong>, with applications to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heavy quarkonium systems, such as charmonium and bottomonium</li>
    <li>Exotic heavy-quark states (XYZ resonances)</li>
    <li>Development and application of <strong>non-relativistic effective theories</strong> in QCD and QED</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The main tool that allows me to address such diverse problems is <strong>quantum field theory</strong>, particularly in its modern effective formulation. Much of my work has focused on <strong>non-relativistic systems</strong> and the study of <strong>heavy bound states</strong>. Investigating dark-matter bound-states, charmonium and bottomonium has been crucial in understanding the formation of a new state of matter.
